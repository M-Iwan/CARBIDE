Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot provide the complete mapping 
from medical terms found in FAERS to MedDRA terms. The cardiotoxicity_terms.csv
file only contains the specific MedDRA Preferred Terms 
used to define our cardiotoxicity endpoints (Cred, Card, and Cvas sets).

To reproduce the data preprocessing steps in full, 
you will need to obtain a MedDRA license and associated files from:
